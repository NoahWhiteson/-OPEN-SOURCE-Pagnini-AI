ðŸ¤–PAGNINI AI ðŸ¤–

Pagnini AI is a open source, highly intelligent Ai that responds to your voice. Say "hey friday" and wait for a sound to play. This means the AI is listening, anything you say next will be run through llama3 or tinyllama (for raspberry pis). It will automaticly speak its response through one of your speakers.

Run the command and locate the folder you want to use for hold the file 
`cd {location} `

The run the clone git command
`git clone https://github.com/PrisumDevolopes/-OPEN-SOURCE-Pagnini-AI`

Install Ollama here: https://ollama.com/download

Open your terminal/console and run the command ( ollama run tinyllama ) or ( ollama run llama3 )
Once it finishes go to this link here: http://localhost:11434/
If it says Ollama is running, then you know its working. If it says anything other than that, then the program has failed and search for a explination video as this is primarily mean't for the AI and not Ollama. 


Once your finished install these packages using the pip command ( assuming you have pythin installed )
`pip install tkinter sounddevice numpy pygame SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 tensorflow`


After this locate the file where both python files are installed and copy the location into your terminal
`cd {location of file}`

Then run python `llama3.py` or python `tinyllama.py`

When the pyGame GUI opens, select a microphone and hit the hide microphone button. To start say "Hey Friday" and wait for a listening text to appear or a sound to play.
Then state your sentence clearly and the AI will do its work and provide a output.
